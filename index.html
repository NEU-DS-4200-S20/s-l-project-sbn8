    <h1>SBN8: Boston Local Food Festival Data Vizualization. DS 4200 S20</h1>

    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781714">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dcashm01/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>The following visualizations were created in collaboration with SBN in order help show off what SBN has been able to accomplish so far to potential sponsors. It is important for SBN to of acquire funding from organizations other than the State of Massachusetts in order for their organization to be more financially flexible. Our hope is that our visualization will be able to further highlight the successes of the food festival, especially for the further advancement of their mission statement. </p>
    
    <p>
      One of the main things that SBN emphasizes is their diversity in their demographics. It is also a key feature that they are proud of wish to show off. As a result, our main focus will be to navigate the user through the our visualization to highlight their diversity. 
    </p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>
    
  </div>
  
  <!-- Your visualization here -->
  <div class="vis-holder">
    <!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>
    
    <video controls width="100%">
      <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
       a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <ul> Remaining Implementation Steps:
      <li> Fix map zooming and bordering </li>
      <li> Brushing with attendee information (besides location)</li>
      <li> Link individual attendee view to the overall map</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <p>
    We heavily utilized the zip-code data to locate attendees, and to act as bins for multiple attendees from the same area. Additionally, we use the income level (categorical), race (categorical), and favorite experiences (activity/cuisines) from the food festival (qualitative, non-categorical). The data is sourced from surveys handed out during the food festival and was then given to us in an excel file. Some preparation/preprocessing in excel was required to make managing the data go smoothly. [Outline that process here].</p>
    
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <p>
      There are three main tasks that our vizualization hopes to accomplish.
    </p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>Demographic Analysis</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasizing the wide array of demographic backgrounds across all the food festival attendees is an important point of upsell to potential future sponsors. As a result, our vizualization should provide an interactive, user-friendly way to display the different categories of demographic information available to festival organizers (i.e. Race, Income levels, Attendee point of origin, etc.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>Cuisine Popularity Analysis</li>
        <ul>
          <li>We also want to be able to vizualize the popularity of particular food cuisines that are present at the Boston Food Festival.</li>
          <li>In conjunction with our Demographic Analysis, we hope to be able to gain some insight in how particular food cuisines rate among members of different demographic groups.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Food Purchasing Habits Analysis</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If the mission of the Boston Local Food Festival is to raise awareness about various local food options, one measure of success could be whether attendees actually end up purchasing food products that were previously unknown to them.</li>
          <li>Analysing the cuisines of newly purchased products could point out newly rising food trends among different demographic groups and provide insight as to what types of vendors could perform better in future events.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    
    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>

    <strong> TODO </strong>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>

    <strong>TODO</strong>
